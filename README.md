# Coinbase Pro Live Orderbook

This project maintains Coinbase Pro's live BTCâ€¢USD order book using the full websocket channel. 

The project also contains a JUnit test to verify the accuracy of the order book. The test periodically compares a snapshot of its websocket-maintained orderbook, with a snapshot of the order book retrieved from the REST API.
